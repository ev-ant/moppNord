abstract = {Retaining the student-friendly approach of previous editions, Introduction to Econometrics, Fourth Edition, uses clear and simple mathematics notation and step-by step explanations of mathematical proofs to help students thoroughly grasp the subject. Extensive practical exercises throughout--including fifty exercises on the same dataset--build students' confidence and provide them with hands-on practice in applying techniques. NEW TO THE FOURTH EDITION: * An expanded review section at the beginning of the book offers a more comprehensive guide to all of the statistical concepts needed to study econometrics * Additional exercises provide students with even more opportunities to put theory into practice * More Monte Carlo simulations help students use visualization to understand the math * New final sections at the end of each chapter contain summaries and non-technical introductions to more advanced topics},
